This script reads the rows of a Google sheet and generates HTML pages showing thumbnails of objects with pop-ups describing the object.

This script is hardcoded on sheet, column names and picture IDs; it is not a general purpose script.  It is used by a museum to generate HTML pages for objects on a per-room basis.  The Google Sheet is used as a collections object database, where each row of the sheet has fields about the object.
